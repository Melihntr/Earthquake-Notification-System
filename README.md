•	Java program called Earthquake Notification System. Program will receive input from two input files (In real life these would have been real time data streams, but I had to implement a discrete time simulation using static files.) 

•	The first input file provides information on the time, location, and magnitude of earthquakes around the world.

•	 The second input file will be a series of requests by the users of the notification system. The users may request adding a new watcher to the system, removing a watcher, or query for earthquakes.

•	 The program can be viewed as a discrete event simulation, where events could be either earthquakes or user requests; events take place at discrete times, denoted by their timestamps; and are processed in the order that they occur.
